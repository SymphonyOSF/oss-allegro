# Versions and Releases
The Allegro API library (as well as several other Symphony Open Source projects) is released to maven central for major and minor releases.
Patch releases are distributed internally to Symphony.

The **master** branch of the source repository represents the current minor (public) version.
The **dev** branch represents the current patch (internal) version.

In order to build and use the **dev** branch you need to have credentials for the Symphony internal distribution repos
in your **settings.xml** file. If you are a Symphony employee, search for "Open Source Libraries" in Confluence for details.
