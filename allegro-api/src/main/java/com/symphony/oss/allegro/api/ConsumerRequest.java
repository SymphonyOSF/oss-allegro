/**
 * Base class for request objects which take Consumers.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of payload to be consumed.
 * 
 * When the consume method is called the consumer with the most specific type to the object
 * being consumed will be selected. Objects will be unwrapped if necessary to obtain a more
 * specific type to match with a consumer.
 * 
 * Sub types of the following types are considered more specific than the ones which follow:
 * <ul>
 * <li/>IChatMessage
 * <li/>IApplicationObject
 * <li/>IFundamentalPayload
 * <li/>IFundamentalObject
 * </ul>
 * 
 * For example, if a FundamentalObject containing a SocialMessage was consumed, then consumers
 * would be selected in the following order of precedence:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li/>IReceivedChatMessage
 * <li/>IChatMessage
 * <li/>ISocialMessage
 * <li/>ILiveCurrentMessage
 * <li/>IApplicationObject
 * <li/>IClob
 * <li/>IFundamentalPayload
 * <li/>IFundamentalObject
 * <li/>Object
 * </ul>
 * 
 * In fact, when reading from the object store, the object being consumed will always be an instance of
 * IFundamentalObject and when reading from a feed the object will always be an instance of INotification
 * so registering a consumer of those types represents a "catch all", but it is also possible to
 * register a handler of type Object if this is preferred.
